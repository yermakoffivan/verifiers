"""The error model — every rollout failure is attributed to one boundary, then recorded once.

Four mechanisms, each in one place:

1. Vocabulary (this module): `RolloutError` and the flat boundary types below. Each names the
   boundary a failure crossed — provider, harness, toolset, sandbox, task, or
   interception — so a recorded `trace.last_error.type` says where the rollout broke.
2. Classification (`boundary`): the one helper that runs a framework→code boundary and attributes
   any escaping error to that boundary's type. Extension code (task hooks, harness subclasses)
   raises plain Python errors — it never constructs a `vf` error type; `boundary` classifies them.
   Infra that fails raises its type at the source (`runtimes` → `SandboxError`, `clients` →
   `ProviderError`, tunnels → `TunnelError`); an already-typed `RolloutError` passes through unchanged.
3. Surfacing (`session.RolloutSession.error` / `fatal_error`): a model or tool call fails behind
   the harness subprocess and comes back as HTTP, so the interception server stashes the real
   error and the rollout re-raises it once the harness returns — not a secondary `HarnessError`.
4. Capture (`Rollout`, mirrored by the env-server): the one place that records a failure (typed
   or not) onto the trace and never lets it cancel sibling rollouts. A bad rollout is data, not a
   crash.

The detail (status code, stderr, ...) comes from the wrapped inner error; we add a type only when
the boundary isn't already clear from it.
